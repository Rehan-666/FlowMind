# FlowMind 🧠🌊

> A smart, AI-powered productivity assistant that helps you enter your “flow state” — the mental zone where you’re fully focused, deeply engaged, and doing your best work.

## 🌟 Features

- Add, delete, complete tasks (core to-do list)
- “What should I do now?” — AI suggests the best task for your mood/energy
- Break down big tasks into manageable subtasks using AI
- Track mood, energy level, and match tasks to your current focus
- Simple, clean UI inspired by human-focused UX

## 💡 Why FlowMind?

Inspired by the psychology of **Flow State**, FlowMind removes the friction between your brain and your work. You don’t just manage tasks — you get gently guided into *doing the right thing at the right time*.
